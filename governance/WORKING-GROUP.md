## Decision Process

### Specification Changes

**Minor changes** (clarifications, typos, examples):
- Author proposes via Pull Request
- 1 Working Group member approval required
- Merged within 7 days

**Major changes** (new normative requirements, breaking changes):
- RFC process (see CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Discussion period: 14-30 days
- Consensus required (all Working Group members agree OR no blocking objections)

**New specifications** (NORP-009+):
- Proposal document required (motivation, scope, draft requirements)
- Community feedback period: 30 days minimum
- Working Group approval by consensus

### Version Numbering

- **Minor version** (1.0 → 1.1): Clarifications, non-breaking additions
- **Major version** (1.x → 2.0): Breaking changes to normative requirements

---

## Governance Philosophy

**Transparency**: All decisions documented in GitHub issues/discussions

**Meritocracy**: Contributions matter more than titles

**Production-first**: Specifications driven by real-world production needs, not theory

**Vendor-neutral**: No single vendor dictates NORP direction

---

## Meeting Schedule

**Current**: Ad-hoc (as needed for spec changes)

**Future** (when Working Group ≥3 members): Monthly sync (public, recorded)
